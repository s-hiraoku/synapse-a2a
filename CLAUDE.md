## Development Flow

1. Write tests first → confirm spec → implement → pass all tests
2. **Default base branch is `main`** for all PRs
3. Do NOT change branches during active work without user confirmation (worktree agents are exempt)

## Commands

```bash
uv sync                                  # Install
pytest                                    # All tests
pytest tests/test_foo.py -v               # Specific file
pytest -k "test_bar" -v                   # Pattern match
```
