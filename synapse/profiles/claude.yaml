# Multi-strategy idle detection configuration
# Claude Code: Use timeout-based detection
# Note: BRACKETED_PASTE_MODE only appears at startup, not on subsequent idles,
# so we rely on timeout-based detection for reliable idle state detection

  strategy: "timeout"              # Pure timeout-based detection
  timeout: 0.5                     # 500ms no output = idle
