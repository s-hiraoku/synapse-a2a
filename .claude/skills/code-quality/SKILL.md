# Code Quality Check

This skill runs code quality tools (ruff, mypy, pytest) and optionally simplifies code.

## Usage

```
/code-quality [options]
```

### Options

- `--all` or `-a`: Run on all synapse/ files (default: recently modified files only)
- `--no-simplify`: Skip code-simplifier agent (by default, code-simplifier runs after checks pass)
- `--fix` or `-f`: Auto-fix ruff issues with `--fix` flag
- `--test` or `-t`: Run pytest after linting passes
- `--full`: Run all checks including tests (equivalent to `--fix --test`)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Target Files

If `--all` flag is provided:
- Target all files in `synapse/` directory

Otherwise:
- Run `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` to get recently modified files
- Filter to only `.py` files in `synapse/` or `tests/`

### Step 2: Run Ruff Linter

```bash
ruff check [files]
```

If `--fix` flag is provided:
```bash
ruff check --fix [files]
```

Report any errors found. If errors remain after fix, stop and report.

### Step 3: Run Mypy Type Checker

```bash
uv run mypy [files]
```

Report any type errors found. If errors exist, stop and report.

### Step 4: Run Tests (if --test or --full)

If `--test` or `--full` flag is provided AND ruff/mypy passed:

```bash
pytest
```

For running specific tests related to modified files:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Report any test failures.

### Step 5: Run Code Simplifier (Default)

By default, run code-simplifier after all checks pass. Skip with `--no-simplify` flag.

Use the `code-simplifier:code-simplifier` agent to simplify the recently modified code:

```
Task tool with subagent_type: code-simplifier:code-simplifier
Prompt: Simplify and refine the recently modified code in [files].
Look for opportunities to reduce duplication, simplify conditionals,
and improve readability while maintaining all functionality.
```

### Step 6: Report Results

Summarize:
- Number of files checked
- Ruff status (pass/fail, errors fixed if --fix)
- Mypy status (pass/fail)
- Pytest status (pass/fail, skipped if not run)
- Code simplifier status (run by default, skipped if --no-simplify)

## Error Handling

When errors are found:

1. **Ruff errors**: If `--fix` is provided, attempt auto-fix first. Report remaining errors with file:line format.
2. **Mypy errors**: Report type errors with file:line format. Suggest fixes based on error messages.
3. **Test failures**: Report failed test names and assertion errors. Do NOT proceed to simplification if tests fail.

## Examples

### Basic check on recent changes
```
/code-quality
```

### Check all files with auto-fix
```
/code-quality --all --fix
```

### Full quality check with tests
```
/code-quality --full
```

### Run with tests only
```
/code-quality --test
```

### Skip code simplification
```
/code-quality --no-simplify
```

### Shorthand
```
/lint          # Same as /code-quality (includes simplification)
/check         # Same as /code-quality
/lint -a -f    # All files with auto-fix
/lint -t       # With tests
/lint --full   # Full check (--fix --test)
/lint --no-simplify  # Skip simplification
```

## Tool Configuration

This project uses the following configurations (from pyproject.toml):

### Ruff
- Target: Python 3.10
- Line length: 88
- Rules: E, F, I, UP, B, SIM
- Ignored: E501, B008
- Excluded: synapse/proto/a2a_pb2*.py

### Mypy
- Strict mode with disallow_untyped_defs
- Tests have relaxed rules (ignore_errors)
- Proto files excluded

### Pytest
- asyncio_mode: auto
- Run with: `pytest` or `pytest tests/ -v`
